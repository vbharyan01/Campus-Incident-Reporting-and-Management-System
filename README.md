# Campus Incident Reporting and Management System

A comprehensive, role-based incident management system designed for educational institutions to handle facility issues, safety problems, and equipment failures with proper workflow management and audit trails.

## 🎯 Purpose

This system enables users to:
- **Anonymously report** facility issues and safety concerns
- **Track incident lifecycle** from initial report to resolution
- **Manage assignments** to maintenance staff
- **Maintain detailed logs** of all resolution activities
- **Generate reports** and analytics for administrative oversight

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.2.0 with Java 17
- **Database**: H2 in-memory database (configurable for production)
- **Security**: Spring Security with role-based access control
- **API**: RESTful API with comprehensive endpoints
- **Validation**: Bean Validation (JSR-380)
- **Auditing**: JPA auditing for automatic timestamp management

### Core Components

#### 1. JPA Entities
- **User**: Role-based user management with anonymity support
- **IncidentReport**: Core incident tracking with status workflow
- **IncidentCategory**: Categorization with priority levels
- **IncidentStatus**: State machine for incident lifecycle
- **ResolutionLog**: Detailed activity tracking and audit trail
- **StatusUpdate**: Status transition history with notes

#### 2. Business Logic Layer
- **IncidentService**: Comprehensive incident management operations
- **Role-based permissions**: Different access levels for different user types
- **Workflow management**: Enforced status transitions
- **Audit logging**: Complete history of all changes

#### 3. Data Access Layer
- **Repository interfaces**: Custom query methods for complex operations
- **JPA relationships**: Proper entity associations and cascading
- **Performance optimization**: Lazy loading and efficient queries

## 🔐 Security & Roles

### User Roles
1. **REPORTER**: Can submit and view their own incidents
2. **MAINTENANCE**: Can view assigned incidents and update status
3. **ADMIN**: Full system access and management capabilities

### Access Control
- **Anonymous reporting**: Users can report without full identification
- **Role-based permissions**: Different operations available per role
- **Data isolation**: Users can only see incidents they're authorized to view
- **Audit trails**: All actions are logged with user attribution

## 📊 Incident Lifecycle

### Status Workflow
```
REPORTED → UNDER_REVIEW → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → RESOLVED → CLOSED
    ↓           ↓           ↓           ↓
CANCELLED   CANCELLED    ON_HOLD    ON_HOLD
```

### Business Rules
- **Status transitions**: Enforced workflow with validation
- **Assignment logic**: Only maintenance staff can be assigned
- **Priority management**: Automatic priority based on category
- **Resolution tracking**: Time, cost, and material logging
